    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It is a module in the Python standard library that provides mechanisms for defining and working with abstract base classes and abstract methods.

They are a way to define a common interface or set of methods that must be implemented by concrete (derived) classes.\n",

    "Data abstraction is one of the key principles in object-oriented programming (OOP).

Achieving data abstraction in Python (or any OOP language) involves several techniques:\n",

    "\n",
    "By defining attributes as private (using naming conventions like _attribute_name) and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify those attributes, you can control how data is accessed and modified from outside the class. This allows you to hide the internal implementation details.\n",

    "\n",
